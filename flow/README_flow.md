This folder contains two Python files that can be downloaded and easily executed to simulate 'Default' instrument spectra for viper to decode. One needs the following packages as prerequisites:

```
!pip install numpy, argparse, ast, datetime, math, random, astropy, scipy, pandas, argparse, re
```

Once this step is done, we can first dive into the helper sort of code, simulate_planetary_system.py. One can use this Python file to easily input standard code to generate command code that writes the command for the generator.py file, allowing for the creation of any given number of synthetic files.
